## About the exercices
 **In this repository you will find the answers to the technical test
 which is composed of three _Exrecices_, there is also the data files and the test document**
 > A brief description of the exercices and the solutions i implemented to answer the test:
 ### Exercice1 :analyse & visualisation
 #### the file : Exercice_1.py
**The goal was about manipulating data using frequencies as a measurment to compare codes, i used some basic libraries such as Numpy to manage arrays, 
collections to calculate frequencies, statistics for the median and mean and matplotlib to visualise and compare results**
### Exercice2 :Algorithmic
### the file : Exercice_2.py 
> in this algorithm the user shoul input the lenght of the array the minimum value and maximum value.
**In the second algorithm i created a recursive function based on what so called divide and conquer, in optimization and to look for the optimum solution we use the binary search or dichotomy which are efficients algorithms. 
In this algorithm i used some a classic library: random to generate random numbers to test my algorithm**

### Exercice3 :Machine learning
### the file : Bert_roBerta.ipynb
**For this exercice i used Google Colab to afford a GPU, i folloxed the documentation of Hugging Face using transformers to train my data from loading dataset until the training of the model, unfortunatly the model didn't train.**
